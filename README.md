A project which calls the Google Books API and stores the output in JSON files.
This project was made in conjuction with the [AR Books][1] project.

In order for this project to work, you need to have a API_key, client_id and client_secret. These can be found or made in the Google Developer Console. Don't forget to put them in a file called `config.txt` after creating them.
